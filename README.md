# Image Processing

***A collection of my Image Processing Projects from my undergraduate coursework***

**Gained a deep understanding and implemented the following concepts within Image Processing :**
>
* **Point operations:**
  * thresholding, quantization, clipping, gamma correction, contrast enhancement
* **Neighborhood operations:**
  * blurring, sharpening, convolution, halftoning, error diffusion 
* **Fourier transforms:**
  * discrete Fourier transform (DFT), fast Fourier transform (FFT)
* **Digital filtering:**
  * sampling theory, image resampling, image reconstruction, antialiasing 
* **Geometric operations:**
  * spatial transformations, separable warping, 2-pass scanline algorithms, affine and perspective transformations, texture mapping, morphing
